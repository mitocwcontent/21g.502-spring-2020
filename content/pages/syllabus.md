Course Objectives and Procedures
--------------------------------

This course covers _Genki I_ Lessons 7 through 12, enhancing the basic skills for conversation, reading, and writing. The program emphasizes active command of Japanese, not passive knowledge. Your goal is not simply to study the grammar and vocabulary, but to acquire skills necessary to use them in a linguistically and culturally appropriate way. By the end of the semester, you will be able to carry on a daily conversation with Japanese people. You will also learn approximately 90 Kanji characters in this course.

In this course there are two types of class sessions, grammar sessions and drill sessions. In grammar sessions, information necessary for using the language, such as grammar, vocabulary, and socio-cultural information, will be provided primarily in English.

Drill sessions are conducted almost entirely in Japanese. Sessions will concentrate on speaking activities that require you to use the language actively. You can achieve good daily performance scores when you have learned and practiced the assigned drills before coming to class.

The class size is limited to 16 students for pedagogical purposes.

12.  _Attendance Policy_
    1.  Attend all sessions. Because of the cumulative nature of language learning, it is essential that you attend all sessions and keep up with the course work on a daily basis. Please follow the online daily schedule and come to class well-prepared.
    2.  _Be punctual_. Coming in late not only results in missed performances and quizzes that may not be made up for, but also distracts other students. Showing up late may affect your daily grade negatively.

There are two oral interview tests, five lesson quizzes and a one-hour exam. Vocabulary, Kanji and conjugation quizzes are given throughout the semester.

14.  _Homework Policy_

Submit all assignments at the beginning of the class. _Late submission will result in a 5% deduction in grade each day_. No credit will be given after three days. Any assignment you submit must be _your own work_.
